# Evolutionary-Algorithms-for-Reinforcement-Learning

In this Repository, you can find the two implementations mentioned in our report for our work on "Evolutionary Algorithms for Reiforcement Learning". 

References:
- The Frozen Lake implementation is based on: https://gist.github.com/malzantot/02f6fb01c2de93977f8c64f6d1aba605#file-frozenlake_genetic_algorithm-py 
- the CarPole implementatio n is based on: https://github.com/paraschopra/deepneuroevolution/blob/master/openai-gym-cartpole-neuroevolution.ipynb
